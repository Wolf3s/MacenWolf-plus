Some things that could be added or adjusted:

* Exact Pac-man ghosts behavior in case something is off
* More accurate victory/gameover sprite scaling
* Fixes: adjust statusbar key coords (e.g. 1280x600), weapon sprite size, fix viewsize<19 for various video resolutions
* Fix Mac-style projection view (Distorted walls when too close. Maybe better fineangles, tangent?)
* Fix whatever needs fixing
* Fix anything that doesn't make sense
* Delete all and just port it to Doom like every other game
* Move it to SDL2
* Add aspect ratio options
* Move the config.wl6 to the main folder and have a highscore config for mod folders
* Simplify the file systems (igagraph, vgagraph, single image files, etc.) or load mac files directly (lzss compressed)
* Frontend menu loader for mods because a batch file (command line) is too hardcore for some people
* Add a mouse cursor to menu
* Add more script features for mods
* Port more bugs and glitches from the original just for fun or for mods that require them
* Port it to other systems
